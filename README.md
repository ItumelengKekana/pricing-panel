# pricing-panel

This pricing panel project was done in one of the lessons in the online bootcamp for web development that i ahve been taking.

This project comprises only of HTML and CSS; no frameworks were introduced yet.

The main outcomes of this assessment were to further understand some advanced CSS concepts such as pseudo classes and elements. Transistions were also something that we leant to make use of. Lastly, media queries were introduced and we got to learn about them and implement them quite effeciently.
